# transformer_from_scratch
My implementation of the 'Attention is all you need' paper. My main purpose of implementing this was
to improve my understanding and tie together the various concepts found across the literature. These resources helped me:
1. The paper
2. Pytorch's implementation
3. Jay Alammar's blog: https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/
4. Aleksa Gordic's repo: https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-original-transformer
